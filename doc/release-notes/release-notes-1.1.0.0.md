How to Upgrade Wallets
--------------
(!) Always backup your wallet.dat before attempting a wallet update (File -> Backup Wallet if you are using the GUI wallet, or copy wallet.dat from the PAWS working directory to the external storage).

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/PAWS-Qt (on Mac) or
pawsd/paws-cli (on Linux).


How to Upgrade Masternodes
--------------
